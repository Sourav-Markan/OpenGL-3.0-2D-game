# OpenGL-3.0-2D-game
2D game with keyboard and mouse controllers in OpenGL
The world consists of a floor with a small semicircular pond and a trampoline. Flying balls of
different colours (each corresponding to certain points) will traverse the screen above the
ground at various heights (random) from left to right. The balls need to be densely located sothat its possible to destroy multiple balls using the boost obtained by destroying one. Some
of the flying balls should have a rectangular slab attached at different angles, if the players
lands on these slopes he/she would be launched at an angle of reflection from the
perpendicular to the slab following the laws of reflection. Later, a magnet should appear and
disappear randomly on either sides of the game which will cause the playerâ€™s motion to be
influenced (make sure projectile like motion [constant horizontal acceleration] is followed). At
a later level, spiked porcupines should appear which if the player lands on will result in a
penalty incurred and the porcupine disappears. Your initial game can have fixed boundaries
where attempting to cross the boundaries would not work and you would be reflected back.
For bonus, you can create a game without boundaries where the world can be extended
indefinitely (similar to a Mario game).
